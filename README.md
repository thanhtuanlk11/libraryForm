# Library Management System
A Library Management System that I made using C#, .NET and Windows Forms.
This project was made just for fun in a week of time when I learned C# so that I can make something tangible.
It implements all the checks so that there is no erros when books are added, removed, issued from the database etc.

*To make the system working, the connetion string needs to be changed so that it can connect to the right server.*
